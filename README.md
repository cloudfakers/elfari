# ElFari
## What is this?

Just what the world needs, an IRC bot. A quite clumsy one.

## What does?

Very little indeed. Mostly annoy people by playing music from youtube in the office. Sometimes also annoy people on Twitter.

## Installation

You definitely shouldn't install this software. This is just a pet project to provide some kind of "jukebox" to the office.

```
git clone git@github.com:ssedano/elfari

cd elfari && bundle
```

Tune `config/config.yml` file and run either the `run.sh` or `elfari.rb`.

## Configuration

Recommended line to launch `VLC`:

```
vlc -vvv --ignore-config -I lua --lua-intf cli --no-video --lua-config "rc={host='0.0.0.0:4000',flatplaylist=0}"
```

## Note on players

There are three supported players:

* MPlayer (does not support native streaming).
* VLC (When streaming, and duplicating the channel to local the volume is desactivated).
* MPD (Playing some flv from youtube a few songs won't start playing due to a bad choice of decoder plugin made by MPD. Even a fewer number MPD will try to format them to whatever the value is set in your config thus incurring in several <i>ALSA underrun on device </i> which outputs a very unpleasant noise).

## Commands

The most rewarding ones are:

* aluego some crappy song
- Queries youtube API for videos containing the terms "some crappy song". Then it simply adds to the playlist the first one.

* ponme er some crappy song
- Plays, if any, a song which title contains the terms "some crappy song".

* ponme argo
- Plays a random song from the database

* apunta http://youtu.be/video
- Adds that crappy song that you love to the song database

* genardo dice here comes a tweet
- Tweet using the credentials the status "here comes a tweet".

* genardo alecciona
- This command accepts parameters. Search for a tweet with the parameters (if no parameters, just any tweet), sends its words to Google Spell Checker API, substitute all coincidences with the first correction, then sends the corrected tweet to its original author. Note that here I use the term "corrected" very lightly, most of the times it just fails miserably correcting it.

## Troubleshooting

Every now and then `youtube downloader` need to be updated. Do so by issuing this command (\*NIX):

```
sudo youtube-dl -U
```

`VLC` can also be launched in a console and `ElFari` will connect to it instead of starting an instance. This is useful to see the output of `VLC`.
